# Programming-282-Campus-Student-Management-System-CSMS-
This project spans the entire duration of the module and is divided into two milestones. It covers various aspects including Data Access, Business Logic, Windows forms, File I/O, and Exception Handling.

**Outline**:
The project entails creating a Windows-based application for managing student information for a campus. It requires a Multi Layered Architecture with three tiers: Presentation Layer (Windows Forms GUI), Business Logic Layer (CRUD functions and File I/O), and Data Access Layer (ADO.Net and SQL Database). The project is part of the Programming 2X2 subject assessment with a total of 100 marks.

**Client Requirements**:

1. Implement a login form with username/password authentication and registration functionality.
2. Provide a GUI for CRUD operations using Windows Forms and ADO.Net, storing data in an SQL Server database.
3. Capture and store student information including student number, name, image, DOB, gender, phone, address, and module codes.
4. Enable read, update, delete, and search functionalities for student information.
5. Capture module information including module code, name, description, and links to online resources.
6. Implement CRUD operations for module information.

**Milestone Requirements**:
**Milestone One (Assignment 1)**:
Submit a detailed report on the planned utilization of Multi Layered Architecture, including:

* Description of Presentation Layer (GUI designs)
* Description of Business Logic Layer (Classes and class members)
* Description of Data Access Layer (Classes and class members)
* Description of Data Layer (Classes and class members)

Include diagrams and dummy methods for classes, without full code implementation.
